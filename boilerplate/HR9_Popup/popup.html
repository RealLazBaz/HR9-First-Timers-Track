		<h3>Demo</h3>
		Notice the timer above?  It is tracking how long you are actively viewing this web page.
		It is smart enough to stop incrementing when you minimize the browser or if you switch to
		a different tab.  Try it out!  It also stops incrementing if you go idle for more than 5
		seconds (meaning you don't move the mouse or enter the keyboard for 5 seconds).  While 5
		seconds is a relatively short time to gauge inactivity, it can be increased to a more
		realistic value (such as 60 seconds) to determine that a user is no longer viewing the page
		and has left the browser or computer altogether.

		<h3>Tracking specific elements</h3>
		TimeMe allows you to track how users are interacting <i>with specific elements</i> on
		your page.  If you go idle, the timer also stops.

		<div class="area-of-interest" id="area-of-interest-1">
			Interact with this element<br/><br/>
			Interaction: <span id="area-of-interest-time-1"></span> seconds.

		<div class="area-of-interest" id="area-of-interest-2">
			Interact with this element<br/><br/>
			Interaction: <span id="area-of-interest-time-2"></span> seconds.
